# Tim's Advent of Code 2021

Some random thoughts as I am working through Advent Of Code 2021.

## Day 1

Chris pointed out that if you're checking `b + c + d > a + b + c`, then you might as well check that `d > a` since the other factors are equal. Funny enough, this works :P

## Day 3

In part 2, I did not understand the assignment. I kept using the full list of commands, not the subset of commands after the initial filtering.

I wasn't able to leverage the work I did in the first part - which depended on the information from the WHOLE collection.

## Day 4

These bingo boards sound like the should be classes, which I am woefully weak with in Go.

Some points to remember:
- member names in the `struct` that are lower case are effectively private.
- You "hang" methods off the struct. There is no class definition.
